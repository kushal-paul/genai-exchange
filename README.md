Choose Better, Live Better -- "Empowering smarter choices with AI-driven insights for healthier, informed consumption."

As the shift towards packaged foods accelerates, companies are increasingly using additives to preserve flavor and extend shelf life. Over 50% of consumers purchase products without reviewing the ingredient list, often due to lack of awareness or time. With the rise of plant-based alternatives, such as plant-based meats, thereâ€™s a growing demand for transparency. Ingredients like "E-numbers" may confuse or deter even health-conscious consumers. The ideal solution is a chat-based assistant where users can share a snapshot of ingredients and receive tailored insights, based on their preferences or specific ingredient queries.

**How are we going to solving this challenge?**

Simplify: Our Gemini model can extract small texts which maybe unreadable for many, and analyse based on saved preferences or just the ingredients impact in general
Educate: User will be able to get information related to any kind of ingredients and their use/impact, which will in turn improve our awareness of products
Immediate Impact: Someone using the solution effectively will be able to understand/identify how they can consume products which will be beneficial for them in short/long term.

**In-Scope:**
Ingredients identification from product labels
Detailed information about the ingredient and the health impact on short/long term use
Usage and portion suggestion for healthy lifestyle
Harmful/potentially allergic ingredient screening
E Numbers and INS numbers identification and decoding

**Out of Scope:**
Medical Diagnosis: The system provides product recommendations but does not perform any medical diagnosis or evaluations.
Product Manufacturing Verification: The system does not verify or guarantee manufacturing processes beyond publicly available data.

**Future Opportunities:**
Expanded Health Profiles: Extend the solution to support more health conditions beyond the initial use case.
Cross-Platform Integration: Integrate with e-commerce platforms to offer real-time product recommendations during shopping.
Advanced Product Recognition: Enhance image recognition to provide deeper insights into ingredient compositions and potential allergens.
Sustainability Metrics: Allow users to track the environmental impact of their product choices over time.
